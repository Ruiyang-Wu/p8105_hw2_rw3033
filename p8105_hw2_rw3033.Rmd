# Problem 1
Read the data
```{r}
library(tidyverse)

prob1_df = read_csv(file = "~/Desktop/BIST8105/HW/p8105_hw2_rw3033/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv", na = c(".", "NA", ""))
view(prob1_df)
```

Clean the data
Convert the entry variable
```{r}
prob1_df = prob1_df |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, 
         route1:route11, entry, vending, entrance_type, ada) |>
  mutate(entry = str_trim(entry), 
         entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE))

str(prob1_df)
view(prob1_df)
```
Variables:
This dataset contains 1,868 rows and 19 columns.
Line, Station Name, Route1 to Route7, vending, Entrance Type are character variables.
Station Latitude, Station Longitude, Route8 to Route11 numeric variables.
Entry and ADA are logical variables.

Data Cleaning Steps:
The column names were cleaned using janitor::clean_names() to standardize the format, making them all lowercase and replacing spaces with underscores.
Only the relevant columns were selected for further analysis: line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, route1 through route11, entry, vending, entrance_type, and ada.
The entry column, initially containing "YES" and "NO", was converted into a logical format (TRUE for "YES" and FALSE for "NO").

Tidiness:
The dataset is not tidy because it contains NA values, and the subway routes are inconsistently representedâ€”some are stored as character (chr) variables while others are stored as numeric (num). This inconsistency makes it difficult to work with the data in a uniform way, as all routes should ideally be represented in a single, consistent format.

Paragraph about these data:
The dataset (TidyTrashWheel_df) provides a comprehensive summary of waste collection metrics from the "Mr. Trash Wheel" initiative. It consists of 15 variables and 1,033 observations, detailing the amounts of various types of waste collected across different dates. The columns include information on waste collection metrics such as weight_tons, volume_cubic_yards, and various categories of trash items, including plastic_bottles, polystyrene, cigarette_butts, glass_bottles, plastic_bags, wrappers, and sports_balls. The data also captures year as numerical data, month as character data, and the exact date of collection, formatted as POSIXct. Additionally, the source column, stored as character data, indicates the sheet from which each row of data originates.

Describe your data cleaning process:
After importing the three datasets, I first checked for missing (NA) values. I ensured that baker names were in a consistent format by using janitor::clean_names() and then separated the full names in bakers.csv into baker and baker_lastname to match the format in bakes.csv and results.csv. Next, I identified bakers present in bakes.csv and results.csv but missing in bakers.csv and filtered out these entries. Finally, I merged the three datasets into combined_df and verified that all rows were distinct to ensure data integrity.

```{r}
# Create a reader-friendly table showing the star baker or winner of each episode in Seasons 5 through 10. 

# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)

# Filter for Seasons 5 through 10 and rows for the Star Baker
star_winner_df = combined_df |>
  filter(series >= 5 & series <= 10) |>
  filter(result %in% c("STAR BAKER", "WINNER")) |>
  select(series, episode, baker, result)

# Order by series and episode
star_winner_df = star_winner_df |>
  arrange(series, episode)

# Create a reader-friendly table
star_winner_df = star_winner_df |>
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = series, 
    values_from = baker)

print(star_winner_df)
```
Comment on the table:
The table presents the Star Baker and Winner results for Episodes 1 through 10 across Seasons 5 to 8. Each column represents a season, and each row corresponds to an episode, showing which baker received the Star Baker title for that particular episode. The final row displays the overall Winner of each season.
The table shows some predictable winners, like Nadiya in Season 6 and Candice in Season 7, who were Star Baker multiple times. However, there were surprises too, such as Nancy winning Season 5 despite Richard earning Star Baker five times, and Sophie winning Season 8 over Steven, who had more Star Baker titles. Consistency doesnâ€™t always translate to victory, making the final outcomes less predictable in some seasons.
